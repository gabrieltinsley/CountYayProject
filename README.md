# CountYayProject
Create a class called CountYay with a main method.

In the main method, write a program that prints multiples of 3 from 100 down to 1 but only if the multiples are odd. 
However if the odd multiple of 3 is also a multiple of 11, then instead of the number print "Yay!"  
(Note: There are no command line arguments and there should be no user input in this method. The output is on one line as shown below.)
